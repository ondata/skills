# onData Skills Project - Planning

## Phase 1: Document & PRD
- [x] Create PRD.md (English) with:
  - Project vision & goals
  - Scope & constraints
  - Skill categories (data, transformation, visualization, etc.)
  - Installation & discovery workflow
  - Catalog structure & metadata requirements
  - Success criteria

## Phase 2: Foundation
- [ ] Create README.md (installation guide)
- [ ] Create CATALOG.md template (skill discovery format)
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md (skill submission guidelines)
- [ ] Setup project structure (docs/, skills/, examples/)

## Phase 3: Skill Template & Standards
- [ ] Define skill metadata schema (name, description, category, usage, etc.)
- [ ] Create skill template/example
- [ ] Document best practices for skill creation

## Unresolved Questions
- Should there be version control for individual skills?
- Who manages the catalog and skill submissions (curation process)?
- Are there tier/maturity levels (alpha, beta, stable) for skills?
- Should there be tests/validation for contributed skills?
- Where will skills actually be stored/deployed?
